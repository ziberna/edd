# Lict is a mix between a list and a dictionary. Features:
#  - values/keys ordered as they were assigned
#  - possible to access and set values via both index and key
#      key: print(var[key]) => prints value
#      index: print(var(index)) => prints key (explained bellow)
#      key: var[key] = value => sets value
#      index: var(index, value) => sets value
#  - possible to pass _anything_ to constructor or update method, it will be
#    automatically added to lict
#
# var(index) prints key:
# This is the only way to get _key_ AND _value_ via index.
# So to set get the value at index x, you would have to do var[var(x)].
