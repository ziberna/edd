   2) nano
   3) geany
> Choose tool or type a command (default=1): 3
> Edited /home/jure/.xinitrc with geany.
[jure@Kant ~]$ ed xinit ask
   1) vim
   2) nano
   3) geany
> Choose tool or type a command (default=1): nano -x
> Edited /home/jure/.xinitrc with nano -x.
[jure@Kant ~]$ ed xinit "vim -e"
> Edited /home/jure/.xinitrc with vim -e.
[jure@Kant ~]$

* It may seem confusing, but before ed says "Edited x with y.", it actually
  opens file x with command y. The message is shown after you have closed the
  tool, tool being an editor with graphical or command-line user interface, or
  any command you wish to pass the file path to.

Tips
====
1. To hardcode path to configuration file, pass the path to main function in
   bin/ed. This is useful for running ed as root with configuration
   file in your home folder.
